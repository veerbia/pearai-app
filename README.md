# Pear: The Best AI-Powered Code Editor

Supercharge your development in an editor designed for less coding, with AI. This repository is a fork of VSCode.

This is the main app for PearAI. The bulk of the functionality is within `extension/pearai`. We recommend simply working within that submodule, by cloning https://github.com/trypear/pearai-extension/.
